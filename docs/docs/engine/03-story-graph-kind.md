# Story-Graph Kind — Content Model

**Document status:** Revision 1 — first build deliverable
**Kind:** `story-graph`
**Implementation language:** TypeScript (shared core with the simulation kind)

> **Scope of this document**
> The concrete content types for the flagship kind: the campaign, its typed variables,
> nodes, choices, requirements, consequences, endings, and achievements — plus the
> runtime state, how a turn resolves, and the projection. Ends with a worked example of
> the MVP's Bureaucracy arc.
>
> - The architecture this obeys: [`02-architecture.md`](02-architecture.md)

This kind reuses the core wherever it can. Types marked *(core)* are defined
in the engine specification and not re-derived here.

---

## 1. The campaign

A story-graph campaign is **data** (§1 of the architecture). It declares everything the
engine needs to run it; the engine never recompiles to load one.

```typescript
interface StoryGraphCampaign {
  // This is the `content` inside the core's `Campaign` envelope (04 §10.1).
  // Envelope-owned identity — id, kindId, version, titleKey — lives on `Campaign`,
  // NOT here, so it cannot drift (the same rule as kindState, §8.1).
  descriptionKey: LocKey;

  variables: VariableSchema;    // §2 — every variable, typed, declared up front
  nodes: Record<string, Node>;  // §3 — keyed by node id
  startNodeId: string;

  achievements: AchievementDefinition[];   // §7
}
```

`id`, `version`, `kind`, and `titleKey` are **not** fields here — they belong to the
core `Campaign` envelope (04 §10.1), which wraps this content. Authors still write
strings inline in the authoring form (§2.4 core); the build lifts them into the
registry's shared `strings` map (04 §10.1), so no per-campaign string table travels at
runtime.

Load-time validation (§11) checks that `startNodeId` exists, every `goto` resolves,
every variable referenced is declared, and every `LocKey` is present.

---

## 2. Variable schema — fully typed (N6)

Every variable a campaign uses is declared here with a type and an initial value.
Reading or writing an undeclared variable is a **load-time error**. Writing a value of
the wrong type is a load-time error. This is the discipline decided in the
architecture's §3.2 — the loose bag is banned.

```typescript
type VarType = "bool" | "int" | "enum";

interface VariableDecl {
  type: VarType;
  initial: boolean | number | string;

  values?: string[];        // enum only — the allowed values
  min?: number;             // int only — clamp floor
  max?: number;             // int only — clamp ceiling

  visible?: boolean;        // surfaced to the player as a stat (§9)
  labelKey?: LocKey;        // required when visible
}

type VariableSchema = Record<string, VariableDecl>;

type VarValue = boolean | number | string;
```

> **⚑ Judgement call — no `string` free-type.** The architecture listed `string` as a
> variable type. Free strings are a determinism and validation hazard (unbounded, no
> load-time check on values) and no story-graph mechanic needs them — narrative text is
> `LocKey`s, not variables. `enum` covers "one of a fixed set." Dropped `string` for
> the MVP; add it back only if a campaign genuinely needs free text in state.

**Player statistics are not a separate system.** A variable marked `visible: true` is a
stat — it appears in the projection (§9) and the client's stats panel. That is the
whole of the "Player Stats" requirement.

**Relationships and money are ordinary variables.** A campaign that tracks the
landlord's opinion declares `int` `landlord_affinity`; one that tracks cash declares
`int` `money`. The story-graph kind imposes no relationship or currency model
(architecture §6.3).

---

## 3. Nodes — the single content type (N7)

A node is a scene: display text, plus what happens after it. The "what happens" is a
discriminated union — the only content type in this kind.

```typescript
type Node = ChoiceNode | RandomNode | AutoNode | EndingNode;

interface NodeBase {
  id: string;
  textKey: LocKey;              // may interpolate visible variables — see §3.1
}

interface ChoiceNode extends NodeBase {
  kind: "choice";
  choices: Choice[];           // the player picks one
}

interface RandomNode extends NodeBase {
  kind: "random";              // engine picks, seeded — the only place RNG enters
  transitions: RandomTransition[];
}

interface AutoNode extends NodeBase {
  kind: "auto";                // no player input; one transition, taken immediately
  effects?: Consequence[];
  goto: string;
}

interface EndingNode extends NodeBase {
  kind: "ending";              // terminal — the game ends here
  endingId: string;
  outcome?: "win" | "loss" | "neutral";   // default "neutral"
}
```

Random and auto nodes are **pass-through**: the player never sits on one. After any
transition the engine *settles* — resolving auto/random nodes in turn — until it lands
on a choice or an ending (§8). So "a random event" is a `random` node the engine
resolves and moves past; "an event not reached by a choice" is an `auto`/choice node a
`goto` sends you to.

### 3.1 Text interpolation

A node's `textKey` string may reference **visible** variables: `"Your bank account
contains {money}."` The engine substitutes the current value at render time from the
visible-variable set (§9). Referencing a non-visible or undeclared variable in text is
a load-time error — a hidden variable must not leak through prose.

---

## 4. Choices and transitions

```typescript
interface Choice {
  id: string;
  labelKey: LocKey;

  showWhen?: Condition;        // omit the choice entirely if unmet (secret paths)
  requirements?: Condition;    // show but disable, with a reason, if unmet
  requirementFailKey?: LocKey;

  effects?: Consequence[];     // §5 — typed operations, applied on selection
  goto: string;                // target node id — required, validated
}

interface RandomTransition {
  weight: number;              // relative; seeded weightedPick (core §3.2)
  effects?: Consequence[];
  goto: string;
}
```

Two gates, deliberately distinct:

- **`showWhen`** decides whether the choice *appears at all*. Use it for secrets — an
  option that shouldn't exist until the player has the key. Default: always shown.
- **`requirements`** decides whether a *shown* choice is *selectable*. If unmet, the
  client renders it disabled with `requirementFailKey` as the reason — the Transparent
  Consequences principle. This is the common case.

A `goto` may target the choice's own node — that is how the Bureaucracy loop works
(§12). Cycles are legal here and are a Tier 2 warning, not an error (architecture §9).

---

## 5. Consequences — typed effects

A choice or transition mutates state only through typed operations on **declared**
variables. There is no arbitrary path write — the audit-record discipline from the
simulation kind's §10.4, carried over.

```typescript
type Consequence =
  | { op: "set"; var: string; value: VarValue }
  | { op: "increment"; var: string; by: number }   // int only
  | { op: "decrement"; var: string; by: number };   // int only
```

Validation checks: `var` is declared; the op suits its type (`increment`/`decrement`
require `int`; `set` value matches the declared type / enum values). `int` writes clamp
to the variable's `min`/`max` after applying. Clamping happens once, after all of a
transition's consequences apply — the same rule as the simulation kind's needs (§3.3
there), so a `+5` then `-5` nets to zero rather than clipping.

> **Turn advance is automatic, not a consequence.** The core increments the
> built-in `turn` by 1 on every transition (architecture §6.4). A campaign wanting a
> time *skip* declares its own `int` and advances it — the built-in `turn` stays a
> faithful transition count.

> **Achievements have no `unlock` consequence.** They are conditions (§7), evaluated
> after every turn. To fire one at a narrative moment, set a variable there and let the
> achievement's condition read it. One mechanism, uniform with the simulation kind.
> *(⚑ If authors find this verbose, a direct `unlock` op can be added later — noted,
> not built.)*

---

## 6. Requirements and conditions

Requirements reuse the core's **`Condition` tree verbatim** — `all` / `any` /
`not` / comparisons / `exists` / `count`
([`../games/04-engine-specification.md`](../games/04-engine-specification.md) §13.1). That
operator set is **frozen** ([`04-core.md`](04-core.md) §18) — this kind adds no
operators, only a field namespace. A condition's `field` resolves against this kind's
state:

```text
var.<name>            a declared variable's current value
turn                  the built-in transition counter
visited.<nodeId>      how many times a node has become current — counts every entry,
                      including the start node and settle pass-throughs (0 if never; §8.2)
achieved.<id>         whether an achievement is unlocked (bool)
ending                the endingId once ended (else absent)
```

Every `field` is checked at load time against the schema and node set (§11). This is
the *only* stringly-typed surface left in the kind, so it is the one that gets rigorous
path validation — exactly as the simulation kind found (§4.3 there).

Example — the "certificate expired again" gate:

```yaml
requirements:
  all:
    - { field: var.documents_collected, operator: equals, value: true }
    - { field: var.certificate_fresh,   operator: equals, value: true }
```

---

## 7. Achievements

Ported from the simulation kind, scoped to conditions over this kind's state.

```typescript
interface AchievementDefinition {
  id: string;
  nameKey: LocKey;             // "It Builds Character", not "First Ending"
  descriptionKey: LocKey;
  condition: Condition;        // over var.* / achieved.* / ending
  hidden: boolean;             // if true, not listed until unlocked
}
```

Evaluated after every turn (§8). Each fires **exactly once**; the unlock is written to
the durable `PlayerProfile` (simulation kind §16.3) — never to authoritative game
state, so it cannot affect determinism. A missing or corrupt profile degrades to "no
achievements," never a broken game.

---

## 8. Runtime state and the turn

### 8.1 State

The story-graph kind's state is the **kind-specific subset only** — it is the
`kindState` inside the core's `GameState` envelope
([`04-core.md`](04-core.md) §2). Everything kind-agnostic — `gameId`, `seed`,
`rng`, `campaignId`, `campaignVersion`, `status`, and the action log — lives on the
envelope, not here. Duplicating them (as an earlier draft of this section did) would put
the same field in two places and drift.

```typescript
interface StoryGraphKindState {
  currentNodeId: string;
  variables: Record<string, VarValue>;
  turn: number;                            // kind-maintained; settle advances it (§8.2)
  visitedCounts: Record<string, number>;   // nodeId → times entered (every entry; §8.2)
  unlockedAchievements: string[];
  endingId?: string;                        // set when an EndingNode is reached
}
```

- **`status`** (`active` / `ended`) is the envelope's, reported by `advance`'s
  `AdvanceResult.status` (04 §3). The kind sets `endingId` here; the core flips
  status to `ended`.
- **The choice log** is the envelope's generic `actionLog` (04 §2): each `LoggedAction`
  carries the `choiceId` as its `actionId`. There is no separate `LoggedChoice`.
- **`turn`** stays here because a "turn" is kind-specific — a node transition in this
  kind, a week in the simulation kind.

`variables` and `visitedCounts` are subject to the core's sorted-iteration rule
([`04-core.md`](04-core.md) §8 / games/04 §2.2) — a `Record` iterated in a
state-affecting way is sorted first, or a save/load round trip can diverge.

### 8.2 The turn: `submitChoice` → settle

The story-graph kind has exactly **one player action** — submit a choice — with no plan
and no multi-action week (the model that led the simulation kind to drop `executeAction`,
05 §6).

Throughout, **enter(nodeId)** sets `currentNodeId = nodeId` **and** does
`visitedCounts[nodeId] += 1` — so *every* entry counts, including settle pass-throughs
and the initial start node (§8.1).

```text
submitChoice(state, choiceId):
  1. resolve the current node (must be a ChoiceNode) and the named choice
  2. reject if the choice is unavailable: showWhen false, or requirements unmet
     → return ValidationError with the reason, no state change
  3. apply the choice's effects (typed consequences, §5), then clamp
  4. the core appends `{ actionId: choiceId }` to the envelope's actionLog
  5. transition: turn += 1, enter(choice.goto)
  6. SETTLE (below)
  7. evaluate achievements; unlock any newly-satisfied, write to profile
  8. return the new scene (§9), or the ending if status === "ended"
```

**Settle** — the pass-through resolution of non-choice nodes:

```text
settle(state):
  loop (guard: max SETTLE_STEPS, default 64):
    node = current node
    if node.kind == "choice"  → stop; the player acts next
    if node.kind == "ending"  → status = "ended", endingId = node.endingId; stop
    if node.kind == "auto"     → apply effects, clamp; turn += 1; enter(node.goto)
    if node.kind == "random"   → weightedPick a transition from the current RNG handle
                                 (the triggering action's stream, or system:"start" at
                                 createGame — 04 §4/§8);
                                 apply its effects, clamp; turn += 1; enter(its goto)
  if the guard trips → engine error (a content cycle of auto/random nodes with no exit;
     Tier 2 validation warns on such cycles, the guard is the runtime backstop)
```

`createGame` **enters** `startNodeId` (so `visitedCounts[startNodeId]` becomes 1) and
runs `settle` once — drawing any start random transitions from the `system:"start"` RNG
stream (04 §4, §8) — so the first scene the player sees is already a choice or an ending.

**Determinism.** Every random transition draws from the seeded RNG (core §3).
Given the same seed and the same action log, `settle` makes the same picks — so the
whole game replays byte-for-byte (§10). This is the concrete meaning of "deterministic"
for this kind.

---

## 9. Projection — what a client sees

Clients receive a projection, never raw state (architecture §7). For the story-graph
kind:

```typescript
interface StoryGraphView {
  campaignId: string;
  status: "active" | "ended";
  turn: number;

  scene: {
    textKey: LocKey;
    text: string;                 // rendered, visible-variable params substituted
  };

  choices: VisibleChoice[];       // only choices whose showWhen passes
  stats: Record<string, VarValue>; // visible: true variables, with their labels
  unlockedAchievements: string[];  // non-hidden, unlocked

  ending?: { endingId: string; outcome: "win" | "loss" | "neutral" };
}

interface VisibleChoice {
  id: string;
  labelKey: LocKey;
  available: boolean;             // requirements met
  reasonKey?: LocKey;             // present iff not available
}
```

**Excluded from the projection:** non-visible variables, `visitedCounts`, `rng`, the
action log, achievement conditions, and any hidden achievement not yet unlocked. A
`showWhen`-hidden choice is omitted entirely — the client cannot know a secret path
exists. This is what stops a client (or an AI agent over MCP) from seeing state the
player shouldn't.

---

## 10. Determinism, save, versioning

All three are core mechanisms; the story-graph kind only supplies its state shape.

- **Save** = the serialized core `GameState` envelope (which carries
  `campaignVersion`, `seed`, `rng`, `actionLog`, and this kind's `kindState`), in a
  `SaveEnvelope` ([`04-core.md`](04-core.md) §10.2).
- **Determinism harness** — a `{ config, actionLog }` fixture
  ([`04-core.md`](04-core.md) §14) replays to a
  byte-identical `serialize()`, via the golden-file + property tests of §18.4 there.
- **Versioning / migration** — a save records the `campaignVersion` it was made under.
  Loading against a *different* published version runs migration, which must map old
  node ids forward or fail loudly rather than strand the player on a node that no longer
  exists (architecture §8). A migrated save is marked not-replay-compatible.

---

## 11. Validation, story-graph-specific

Tiered as in the architecture §9.

**Tier 1 — load-time, hard fail:**

- `startNodeId` exists; every `goto` and every random `transition.goto` resolves to a
  real node.
- Every variable in a consequence, condition, or text interpolation is declared.
- Every consequence op suits its variable's type; every `set` value is in range / a
  valid enum member.
- Every `LocKey` is present in `strings`.
- No node id, choice id, achievement id, or variable name is duplicated.
- A `visible: true` variable has a `labelKey`; text interpolates only visible variables.

**Tier 2 — load-time, warning:**

- Unreachable nodes — no path from `startNodeId` reaches them (the source's "detect dead
  branches").
- A `choice`/`auto`/`random` cycle with no exit to a choice or ending (would trip the
  settle guard at runtime).
- A campaign with no reachable ending.

**Tier 3 — simulation-time (§18.5 there):** a choice whose `requirements` no reachable
state can satisfy; an ending no path reaches.

---

## 12. Worked example — the MVP Bureaucracy arc

This is the concrete MVP content ([`MVP.md`](MVP.md)): ~6 nodes, typed variables, a
requirement-gated retry, a loop with visit counts, a seeded random node, and the
"It Builds Character" achievement. Authoring form (the build step derives the string
table — architecture §2.4.1).

```yaml
id: bulgaria-bureaucracy
version: "0.1.0"
kind: story-graph
title: "Bulgaria — The Bureaucracy Arc"
startNodeId: municipality

variables:
  documents_collected: { type: bool, initial: false }
  certificate_fresh:   { type: bool, initial: true }
  patience:            { type: int,  initial: 10, min: 0, max: 10, visible: true, labelKey: stat.patience }
  office_visits:       { type: int,  initial: 0,  min: 0 }
  builds_character:    { type: bool, initial: false }

achievements:
  - id: it_builds_character
    nameKey: ach.builds_character.name        # "It Builds Character"
    descriptionKey: ach.builds_character.desc
    condition: { field: var.builds_character, operator: equals, value: true }
    hidden: true

nodes:
  municipality:
    kind: choice
    textKey: node.municipality.text            # arrive 08:03; "Closed until 11:30"
    choices:
      - id: wait
        labelKey: choice.wait
        effects: [ { op: decrement, var: patience, by: 2 } ]
        goto: clerk_review
      - id: coffee
        labelKey: choice.coffee                # meet the mayor's cousin
        effects: [ { op: set, var: documents_collected, value: true } ]
        goto: clerk_review

  clerk_review:
    kind: random                               # she smiles... or she doesn't
    textKey: node.clerk_review.text
    transitions:
      - weight: 3
        effects: [ { op: set, var: certificate_fresh, value: false } ]
        goto: expired                          # a certificate is now over three months old
      - weight: 1
        goto: room_14                          # you are sent onward

  expired:
    kind: choice
    textKey: node.expired.text
    choices:
      - id: begin_again
        labelKey: choice.begin_again
        effects: [ { op: decrement, var: patience, by: 3 } ]
        goto: municipality                     # the loop
      - id: question_reality
        labelKey: choice.question_reality
        requirements: { field: var.patience, operator: less_or_equal, value: 3 }
        requirementFailKey: req.too_much_patience
        goto: reward                           # only the truly worn-down may pass

  room_14:
    kind: auto
    textKey: node.room_14.text                 # Room 14 sends you to Room 6
    effects: [ { op: increment, var: office_visits, by: 1 } ]
    goto: room_6

  room_6:
    kind: choice
    textKey: node.room_6.text                  # everything happens in Room 14
    choices:
      - id: continue_cycle
        labelKey: choice.continue_cycle
        effects: [ { op: increment, var: office_visits, by: 1 } ]
        goto: room_14                          # the other loop
      - id: go_home
        labelKey: choice.go_home
        requirements: { field: var.office_visits, operator: greater_or_equal, value: 3 }
        requirementFailKey: req.not_yet_broken
        goto: reward

  reward:
    kind: auto
    textKey: node.reward.text                  # €300 and 28 years of legal responsibility
    effects: [ { op: set, var: builds_character, value: true } ]
    goto: ending_character

  ending_character:
    kind: ending
    textKey: node.ending.text
    endingId: it_builds_character
    outcome: neutral
```

What this exercises, one-to-one against the MVP Definition of Done:

- **Typed variables** (bool/int), visible stat (`patience`), clamping (`min`/`max`).
- **Requirement-gated choices** with reasons (`question_reality`, `go_home`).
- **A loop** via self-referential `goto` and **visit counts** (`office_visits >= 3`).
- **A seeded random node** (`clerk_review`) — reproducible from the seed.
- **An achievement** firing once from a variable set at the reward.
- **Two clients** run this identically; **projection** hides `certificate_fresh`,
  `office_visits`, `builds_character` and the RNG.

## 13. Judgement calls

| § | Call | Revisit when |
|---|---|---|
| §2 | Dropped `string` variable type; `enum` covers fixed sets | A campaign needs free text in state |
| §5 | No `unlock` consequence; achievements are conditions over a set variable | Authoring proves it verbose |
| §5 | Built-in `turn` is a pure transition count; time skips are author variables | A kind-level clock is wanted |
| §8.2 | `SETTLE_STEPS` guard default 64 | Profiling or a legitimately deep auto-chain |
| §3 | Four node kinds (choice/random/auto/ending); `auto` is arguably a one-transition `random` | Simplification pass finds `auto` redundant |
| §6/§8.2 | `visited` counts *every* entry (settle pass-throughs + start node), so it works on auto/random nodes | Authors want "times rested here" only |
